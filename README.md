# Overview

digestR is a work-in-progress package containing 3 major elements:

* a database of PFAM abundances from environmental metagenomes (currently focused on marine sediments)
* a proposed map of PFAM categories to metabolic function
* a set of R tools to identify and visualize trends in gene abundance over environmental gradients
